duplicate this folder and name it what you want, for these instructions we will
call it "myEclipse".
Using the Terminal application, navigate to the folder using, "cd foldername".
Then enter "npm init" to initiate the necessary requirements.
Then enter "npm install electron --save-dev".
npm install --save xml2json to install xml stuff.
When you are ready, enter "npm start" to run the application for the first time.
If you close the browser you will need to enter "npm start" in the Terminal
window again. You can refresh the browser using "cmnd R".

---- DISTRIBUTION ----

Make sure the below is entered at the root level on terminal (ie not inside the game folder), if it is not already installed:
yarn add electron-builder --dev

Add this with the correct values to package.json (visit electron.build for details)
"build": {
  "appId": "your.id",
  "mac": {
    "category": "your.app.category.type"
  }
}
Add this to the "scripts" section of the same file:
	"pack": "electron-builder --dir",
  	"dist": "electron-builder"

Now type: yarn pack from the directory of the game

NB there is lot of pages in the reading list of the safari browser
